<h4>Why This Recipe</h4>
<p>
Beets are one veggy that gets overlooked, it is great tasting and 
something to spice up your dinner. Try this easy recipe and 
beets will become a staple.
</p>
<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
    <li>1 1/2 pounds beets (about 3 large or 5 small-to-medium)</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon fine salt, to taste</li>
   

</ul>
<h4>Directions</h4>
<ol>
<li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit and line a large, rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper for easy clean-up. Scrub the beets well with a vegetable brush under running water (no need to peel them at any point).</li>
<li>Using a sharp chef’s knife, slice off the base of each beet to create a flat surface, and slice off the skinny pointy ends as well. Place each beet with its flat side against the cutting board and slice the beets in half, then slice the beets into wedges of even thickness, about ½ to ¾-inch thick on the widest edge.</li>
<li>Place the beet wedges on the prepared baking sheet. Drizzle the beets with the olive oil and sprinkle with the salt. Toss until the beets are evenly coated, then arrange them in a single layer across the pan.</li>
<li>Roast for 35 to 40 minutes, tossing halfway, until you’re able to pierce through the beets with a fork with light pressure. Season with additional salt, to taste, if desired, and serve.</li>

</ol>
